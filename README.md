# Eur-e-clock
The Eure-e-clock alarm clock is designed to address the common problem of hitting the snooze button and going back to sleep after turning off the alarm by introducing an engaging and interactive feature to ensure users are fully awake when the alarm goes off. Instead of merely pushing a button to stop the alarm, users must answer a multiple-choice question on general knowledge available on a web app. The quiz challenge stimulates your brain, ensuring that you are fully awake and starts your day on an intellectually refreshing note.

## Why “EUR-E-CLOCK”
“EUR-E-CLOCK” is a play on the word “EUREKA” and Clock. Eureka means “I have found it” in Greek. It is a reference to the quiz feature that is all about finding the right answer.

## Hardware 
The ESP32 is the microcontroller that connects all the elements together; it processes data coming from the LCD and the web server, it also sends information back to the LCD that displays the current time and to the web page. The buzzer is also controlled by the ESP32. The cable supplies power to the ESP32 and to the LCD.
